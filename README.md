# 1. Library Dependence

[`fftw3`](http://www.fftw.org/) is required for this package.

# 2. How to Install

```
make
make install
```
Then, add the generated directory of `your path to Qinv/bin/`  into your `PATH`.

# 3. Tools

## Binary

- `polarizeP`: invert the Back-Azimuth given NEZ components, and generate corresponding radial and the tangential components;
- `findBestWin`: find the optimal time window, and lag time for incident and the surface reflected waves;
- `qinv`: invert frequency-dependent Q values given single tangential seismogram, and the time windows for incident and reflected waves;
- `stackQ`: stack inverted Q values by sets of seismograms at a single station to get stable values.

## Script for volume production

- `findBestWinSet.py`: batch processing for `findBestWin`.
- `qinvSet.py`: batch processing for `qinv`.
- `stackQ.py`: batch processing for `stackQ`.

## Binary tests

All binaries with name format of `test_...` are for dev unit tests.

# 4.3 `exam_qinv_syn/`

Invert frequency-dependent Q values from the incident and the surface reflected waves.

(low-left): The phase of the transfer function. (low-right): The inverted Q value. Please note that Q value is valid for the frequency band of (0.2, 0.6)Hz , in which the signal power is strong, and the phase of the transfer function is stable and approximates 0 degree.
